            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after
                receiving your item to request a return.
            </p>
            <h3>Eligibility for Returns</h3>
            <p>
                To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that
                you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original
                packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
            </p>
            <h3>How to Start a Return</h3>
            <p>
                To start a return, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:andre@studioplaid.co">andre@studioplaid.co</a>.
                Please note that returns will need to be sent to the following address:

            </p>
            <p>
                If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as
                well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent
                back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
            </p>
            <h3>Damages and Issues</h3>
            <p>
                Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
                the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that
                we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
            </p>
            <h3>Exceptions / Non-Returnable Items</h3>
            <p>
                Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such as
                food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders or
                personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty products).
                We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable
                liquids, or gases.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.</p>
            <h3>Exchanges</h3>
            <p>
                The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you
                have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the
                new item.
            </p>
            <h3>European Union 14-Day Cooling Off Period</h3>
            <p>
                If the merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have the
                right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for any reason and
                without a justification. The item must be in the same condition that you
                received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging.
                You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
            </p>
            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            <p>
                We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let
                you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
                automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10 business
                days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card
                company to process and post the refund too.
            </p>
            <p>
                If more than 15 business days have passed since we’ve approved your
                return, please contact us at <a href="mailto:andre@studioplaid.co">andre@studioplaid.co</a>.
